DMLazyScrollView *2.0*: Lazy Loading UIScrollView (with infinite page scrolling)
================

Re-written, from the ground up. Doesnâ€™t include all features from the forked repo.

Features it does include:
- Optional infinite scrolling
- Paging scroll view, using view controllers
- Simple delegate, similar to a simplified version of UITableViewDelegate and DataSource.
